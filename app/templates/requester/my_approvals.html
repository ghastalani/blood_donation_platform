<h2>Approved Requests</h2>

    <!-- We need backend support to pass approved requests specifically or fetch via AJAX. 
         But simpler to just create a page that fetches them? 
         Or update Dashboard. Let's make this page serve as a "Contact Details" revealer 
         or just update the Dashboard to include this section. 
         Let's stick to updating the Dashboard as per plan "Or update Dashboard". 
         Actually, I will integrate this into dashboard.html instead. -->
